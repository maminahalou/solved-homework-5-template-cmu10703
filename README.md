Use this template to record your answers for Homework 5. Add your answers using L<sup>A</sup>TEXand then save your document as a PDF to upload to Gradescope. You are required to use this template to submit your answers. <strong>You should not alter this template in any way </strong>other than to insert your solutions. You must submit all 15 pages of this template to Gradescope. Do not remove the instructions page(s). Altering this template or including your solutions outside of the provided boxes can result in your assignment being graded incorrectly. You may lose points if you do not follow these instructions.

You should also save your code as a .py or .zip file and upload it to the <strong>separate </strong>Gradescope coding assignment. Remember to mark all teammates on <strong>both </strong>assignment uploads through Gradescope.

<h1><strong>Instructions for Specific Problem Types</strong></h1>

On this homework, you must fill in (a) blank(s) for each problem; please make sure your final answer is fully included in the given space. <strong>Do not change the size of the box provided. </strong>For short answer questions you should <strong>not </strong>include your work in your solution. Only provide an explanation or proof if specifically asked. Otherwise, your assignment may not be graded correctly, and points may be deducted from your assignment.
